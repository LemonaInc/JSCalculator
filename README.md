# JSCalculator
A simple iOS Calculator built with Swift and inspired by Google Material Design.

#The Design
Lots of mobile Calculators lack in design, that why I decided to design my application inspired by Google Material Design. I created a simple ripple effect called (JSButton) which essentially creates a similar look to what you see when running android Lolipop or above.

# The Features

- If you click anywhere outside of the initial screen area, it will clear the calculator and generate a nice ripple effect 
- Basic operations of what a normal handheld calculator would have.
- Simply designed
- Easy to use


# Future Improvements to come

- I want to add more features and more functions to JSCalculator to become more useful
- Landscape mode

#Thank you for checking out JSCalculator
